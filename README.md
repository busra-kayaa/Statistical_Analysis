In this project, statistical analyses are performed on numerical variables in the given dataset. A boxplot is created for each variable to detect outliers, which are then excluded from further calculations. The measures of central tendency and dispersion are calculated for each variable, and the results are displayed on the screen and saved to sonuc.txt. The project is designed dynamically using Python programming language.
